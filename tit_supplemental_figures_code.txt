###Supplemental figures of successful fledlings vs survival to next breeding season
survival <- glm(chick_survival_to_first_breed_season ~ number_chicks_fledged_from_rear_nest, family = binomial, data = tit_clean)
summary(survival)

tit_clean$chick_survival_to_first_breed_season <- as.factor(tit_clean$chick_survival_to_first_breed_season)

ggplot(tit_clean, aes(x = chick_survival_to_first_breed_season, y = number_chicks_fledged_from_rear_nest)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Fledglings vs. Chick Survival",
    x = "Chick Survival to First Breeding Season (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
    y = "Number of Chicks Fledged"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

### There was like no difference in the two boxplots suggesting that the number of fledglings isn't a strong predictor of chick survival to the first breeding season

# Distributions of fledglings between chicks that survived
ggplot(tit_clean, aes(x = number_chicks_fledged_from_rear_nest, fill = chick_survival_to_first_breed_season)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue"), labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of Number of Fledglings by Chick Survival",
    x = "Number of Chicks Fledged",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Survival to First Breeding"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

###This figure again shows there is no correlation between fledgling success and the chick's adult survival
